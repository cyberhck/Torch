Fed up of Flashlight applications who ask you permission which they need not require? Not anymore, after flashlight no permissions, This torch is a free and open source application to turn on your flash light and turn it off back again (useful when there is power cut and you could use your flash light in your phone as a torch) issues and pull requests are welcome, but send me small pull requests (Number of pull requests doesn't matter).<br>
